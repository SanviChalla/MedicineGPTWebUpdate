Sunburn can often lead to peeling and dryness. It's important to start by gently cleansing the affected area with a mild, fragrance-free soap. Follow this up by applying a moisturizer that contains aloe vera or soy to soothe your skin. Avoid picking at the peeling skin and stay hydrated. I'd also recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher in the future to avoid sun damage. Please note that if the condition persists or you notice other symptoms, do consult a healthcare professional in person.", 'time': 'Wed Jul 17 22:15:13 2024', 'emotion_image': 'static/icon.png'}]
